## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE DESIGNED

### Speech-to-Speech Pipeline
```
Microphone
    ↓
VAD (Voice Activity Detection)
    ↓
Voxtral ASR (Speech-to-Text)
    ↓
Conversation Manager (Context)
    ↓
Voxtral LLM (Text-to-Text, 1-word chunks)
    ↓
TTS Manager (Text-to-Speech, streaming)
    ↓
Browser Audio Playback
    ↓
Speaker
```

### Streaming Integration
- 1-word chunks from LLM → TTS immediately
- Audio chunks streamed to browser
- Continuous playback without gaps
- TTFT: 50-100ms (perceived responsiveness)

## 📊 PHASE BREAKDOWN (7 Phases, 25-30 min total)

| Phase | Name | Time | Status | Impact |
|-------|------|------|--------|--------|
| 0 | Token Batching Fix | 5 min | CRITICAL | TTFT 50-100ms |
| 1 | Conversation Manager | 4 min | NEW | Context-aware |
| 2 | TTS Integration | 5 min | NEW | Audio output |
| 3 | Streaming Pipeline | 4 min | NEW | Real-time audio |
