### Part 4: Implementation Approach
Please confirm you approve:

- [ ] **Sequential Implementation**
  - One phase at a time
  - Test after each phase
  - Rollback capability for each phase

- [ ] **Testing Strategy**
  - Verify TTFT after Phase 0
  - Test conversation history after Phase 1
  - Test audio generation after Phase 2
  - Test streaming after Phase 3
  - Test playback after Phase 4
  - Test languages after Phase 5
  - Test WebRTC after Phase 6
  - Test emotions after Phase 7

- [ ] **Rollback Procedures**
  - Each phase independently rollbackable
  - Git-based rollback for code changes
  - Pip-based rollback for dependencies
  - Full rollback: git reset --hard HEAD~7

- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**
  - All changes are additive
  - Existing ASR-only mode still works
  - TTS is optional (can be disabled)
  - No breaking changes

## ‚ùì QUESTIONS TO ADDRESS

### If You Have Questions About:

**Conversation Manager**:
- Why not use existing context management?
  - Answer: None exists in current codebase
- How much context to keep?
  - Answer: Last 5 turns (configurable)
- Will it affect performance?
  - Answer: Minimal (10-20ms overhead)

**TTS Model Selection**:
- Why Chatterbox over Kokoro?
  - Answer: 23 languages vs English-only
- Why not use proprietary TTS?
  - Answer: You required open-source (MIT/Apache 2.0)
- What about voice quality?
  - Answer: Chatterbox is production-grade, comparable to commercial

**Speech-to-Speech Pipeline**:
- Why 1-word chunks?
  - Answer: Optimal balance between latency and naturalness
- What about latency?
  - Answer: TTFT 50-100ms, Total 600-1200ms (acceptable)
- Will it work with WebRTC?
  - Answer: Yes, Phase 6 enables WebRTC

**Phase Breakdown**:
- Why 7 phases?
  - Answer: Each phase 4-5 minutes, independently testable
- Can phases be combined?
  - Answer: Yes, but testing becomes harder
- What if a phase fails?
  - Answer: Rollback and fix, then retry

**Sesame.com Maya Parity**:
- Will we achieve 100% parity?
  - Answer: 80-90% parity after Phase 7
