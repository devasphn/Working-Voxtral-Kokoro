# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds chunked streaming capabilities to the VoxtralModel for real-time audio processing. The enhancement allows the model to process audio input and stream text responses in small, natural chunks (3-5 words) rather than waiting for complete generation, improving perceived responsiveness and enabling more natural conversational interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the VoxtralModel, I want to process real-time audio with chunked streaming responses, so that I can provide more responsive and natural conversational experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio data is provided to the chunked streaming method THEN the system SHALL process the audio and stream text responses in chunks of 3-5 words
2. WHEN the audio energy is below the silence threshold THEN the system SHALL return a response indicating no speech was detected
3. WHEN processing audio THEN the system SHALL log debug information including energy levels, duration, and chunk details
4. WHEN streaming text chunks THEN each chunk SHALL include success status, text content, finality flag, chunk index, and processing time
5. WHEN generation is complete THEN the system SHALL send a final chunk marked with is_final=True

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and resource cleanup in the chunked streaming process, so that the system remains stable and doesn't leak resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs during processing THEN the system SHALL yield an error response with appropriate error message
2. WHEN temporary files are created THEN the system SHALL clean up these files after processing
3. WHEN the model is not initialized THEN the system SHALL raise a RuntimeError with appropriate message
4. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL log error details and return a user-friendly error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the chunked streaming to support different audio input formats, so that I can use various audio data sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio data is provided as a torch.Tensor THEN the system SHALL convert it to numpy array format
2. WHEN audio data is provided as a numpy array THEN the system SHALL use it directly after type conversion
3. WHEN audio conversion is needed THEN the system SHALL ensure proper float32 format and CPU placement

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable streaming parameters, so that I can optimize the streaming behavior for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating text THEN the system SHALL use configurable parameters for max_new_tokens, temperature, and top_p
2. WHEN chunking words THEN the system SHALL use a configurable chunk size (default 4 words)
3. WHEN processing conversation mode THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate chat template formatting
